#Set up
On first run, you will need to authorize your YouTube account with the app twice. A browser window will pop up with a Google login page. The first authorization occurs right away; the second authorization occurs once you hit the "Publish" button. Please authorize both right away and then restart the app. This is a bug, but everything else works after the first run.

You also need the .NET framework installed, which you probably already do. This app only runs on Windows machines.
